In this challenge I issued an AXFR (zone transfer) request with this cmd:

dig +tcp -p 54011 @challenge01.root-me.org ch11.challenge01.root-me.org AXFR

  * `AXFR` asks the authoritative server for the full DNS zone.
  * `+tcp` forces TCP because AXFR commonly uses TCP.
  * `-p 54011` targets the challenge port.
* Server answered with the zone contents. Key line:

  _____
  ch11.challenge01.root-me.org. 604800 IN TXT "DNS transfer secret key : CBk..........."
  _____


# Why zone transfers matter

* DNS servers should restrict AXFR to trusted secondaries. Misconfigured servers will reply to anyone, leaking the whole zone (subdomains, internal hosts, TXT secrets).
* In CTFs admins leave AXFR open intentionally. When you see an open AXFR it is high-value and usually contains the flag.

# How to think as a CTF player (practical mindset)

1. **Scan the problem for protocol clues.**
   The challenge states “DNS” and provides host/port. Immediately think of DNS operations: AXFR, DNSSEC, zonewalk, TXT records, reverse lookups.

2. **Use the simplest canonical tool first.**
   `dig` is the standard. Try an AXFR directly. If it works you’re done. Always try the obvious low-effort attack first.

3. **Enumerate systematically if simple fails.**

   * Find authoritative nameservers (`dig NS domain` or `dig +short @host soa`), try each for AXFR.
   * Try TCP and UDP, and unusual ports if given.
   * Try `host -l domain server` or tools like `dnsrecon`, `dnsenum`.

4. **Look for likely data fields.**
   Flags and secrets often hide in `TXT` records, suspicious hostnames (e.g., `password.domain`), or internal A records pointing to private IPs.

5. **Have a short checklist for DNS tasks**

   * `dig SOA/NS` — authoritative info.
   * `dig AXFR` (TCP) — full zone.
   * `dig ANY` / `dig TXT` — check text records.
   * `dnsrecon/dnsenum` — bruteforce subdomains, AXFR attempts.
   * `nmap -sU/-sT -p <port> --script=dns-zone-transfer` — scripted tests.

6. **Be efficient with tooling**
   Use small, reliable commands you can reproduce. Save outputs (`> zone.txt`) and grep them for `TXT|flag|password|rm{`.

7. **When AXFR is refused**

   * Try zone walking (DNSSEC NSEC/NSEC3) to enumerate names.
   * Brute-force subdomains with wordlists.
   * Look for DNS misconfigurations (AXFR on secondaries, DNS dynamic updates).

8. **Prioritize low-cost high-payoff attacks**
   AXFR is cheap to try and often yields everything. Try it before heavy brute force.

# Concrete commands for next time

* Authoritative server and SOA:

```bash
dig +short NS ch11.challenge01.root-me.org
dig +tcp -p 54011 @challenge01.root-me.org ch11.challenge01.root-me.org AXFR
```

* All TXT records:

```bash
dig -p 54011 @challenge01.root-me.org ch11.challenge01.root-me.org TXT
```

* Scripted/automated:

```bash
dnsrecon -d ch11.challenge01.root-me.org -a -n challenge01.root-me.org -p 54011
nmap -sT -p 54011 --script=dns-zone-transfer --script-args='dns-zone-transfer.domain=ch11.challenge01.root-me.org' challenge01.root-me.org
```

# Tips to train

* Practice on intentionally vulnerable labs: Root-me DNS tasks, HackTheBox (DNS labs), CTFWriteups.
* Read RFC1035 and RFC5936 to know expected behavior.
* Build a checklist for each protocol (DNS, HTTP, SMB, Kerberos) with 5–10 quick tests.

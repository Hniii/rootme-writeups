It seems that one of the anonymous created a new branch in the LDAP directory, somewhere in :
dc=challenge01,dc=root-me,dc=org

Get access to its data and get his email adress.



here we use ldapsearch
and read it again one of the anonumous
one of the anonymous===?
so the company is anonymous hihihi

try this cmd: 

ldapsearch -H ldap://challenge01.root-me.org:54013 -x -b "ou=anonymous,dc=challenge01,dc=root-me,dc=org"
